## What is Cloud Computing

In order to access and use a vast array of computing resources, such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more, on-demand, cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services over the internet. This eliminates the need for hardware upfront investments or on-premises infrastructure.

Fundamentally, cloud computing offers flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness over traditional on-premises IT infrastructure by letting users rent or lease computing resources from cloud service providers on a pay-as-you-go basis.
